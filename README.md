#Modal isng Javascript

## Creation of files
create my html, css, and javascript files.

This project is about creating a modal using Javascript as the main programming language.
A modal is basically a page that has a button, when that button is clicked it brings out the hidden information the person is trying to  hide 

finished the modal project.. to be honest i don't know why i have been encountering problems with toogle method in Javascript lately-- i'm tired.
